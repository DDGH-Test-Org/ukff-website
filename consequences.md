title: Consequences
---

Consequences is an annual larp convention held at Chichester Lakeside Holiday Park in November. It runs from Thursday evening to Sunday afternoon, with typically more than 40 games offered to xxx attendees.

We also play a lot of boardgames and sometimes some tabletop roleplaying games.

Most of the information Consequences is held on the separate site: LINK TO CURRENT

# Venue

Summary of venue. Link to either a sub-page or the relevant page on Conseqences site. (The downside of the latter is that they change each year. Assuming the venue details aren’t changing from year to year, it would be better to have the Consequence site link to here.)

# New to Consequences?

If you’re new to Consequences, welcome! Before you do anything else, please read this from our chair, Ray: <https://r.consequences.org.uk/pages/first-time-at-consequences> [Again, have this here?]]

And if you’ve not played our kind of larps before, we recommend reading What to expect when larping at Consequences:

# Comms
