      UK Freeforms is an unincorporated non-profit organisation promoting freeform-style larps
      in the UK. It does this by organising two annual events: Consequences and a weekend-long
      freeform larp held in Retford.

    <h2>What are freeform larps?</h2>

    <p>
      We use the term “freeform larp” as an umbrella term covering a range of live-action
      roleplaying games.
    </p>

    <p>
      In many freeform larps, players are given prewritten characters with a detailed background
      and information about other characters, along with goals they are trying to achieve.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may also know them as "litform" or "interactive theatre" or "secrets and powers larps"
      or "chamber larps" or "parlour larps." If you’ve played a “horde game” or a “Nordic larp”
      or a “live” or even David Wesley’s 1969 Braunstein, then you’ve probably done something
      very close to what we call a freeform larp.
    </p>

    <p>Or often, just larp.</p>

    <h2>Tell me about Consequences?</h2>

    <p>
      Consequences is an annual larp convention held at Chichester Lakeside Holiday Park in
      November. It runs from Thursday evening to Sunday afternoon, with typically more than 40
      games offered to xxx attendees.
    </p>

    <p>We also play a lot of board games and sometimes some tabletop roleplaying games.</p>

    <h2>Tell me about the weekend larps?</h2>

    <p>
      Each year, we organise a weekend-long freeform in the Best Western hotel in Retford. The
      games run from 8 pm on Friday night until 1 pm on Sunday, with breaks for meals and sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      A typical weekend game involves 60+ players with very detailed character backstories and
      complex plots and mechanics.
