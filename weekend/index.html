        <h1>Weekend freeforms</h1>
      
      <p>Each year UK Freeforms organises a weekend-long freeform for 65+ players, held in the Best Western Hotel in Retford.</p>
<p>We take over most of the hotel for a full weekend, with the game starting at 8 p.m. Friday and finishing about 1 p.m. Sunday lunchtime.</p>
<p>The game is split into five sessions, with breaks for meals and sleep. The sessions are broadly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Friday evening: 8 pm to midnight. Includes game briefing.</li>
<li>Saturday morning: 10 am. To 1 pm</li>
<li>Saturday afternoon: 2 pm to 6 pm</li>
<li>Saturday evening: 8 pm to midnight</li>
<li>Sunday morning: 10 am to 1 pm</li>
</ul>
<p>Timings may change slightly, depending on game needs.</p>
<p>Cost for the game</p>
<p>The cost for the game is typically £150.</p>
<p>Game fees cover renting the hotel, paying for the post-game buffet, and other costs associated with running the game, eg props, printing and any game licensing costs. They also cover accommodation and food for those people involved in organising and running the game. GMs, writers and organisers are not paid for their time.</p>
<p>A limited number of reduced price places are available for children/students/pensioners/unwaged etc.</p>
<h1>Accommodation and meals</h1>
<p>Accommodation and meals are extra. We will book your room with the hotel, but you are responsible for settling your bill.</p>
<p>Breakfast is included, along with tea and coffee during game periods, and a post-game buffet lunch. You must arrange your other meals.</p>
<p>The hotel provides bar meals, and an optional restaurant meal is available on Saturday at about 6:15 pm. There are other restaurants in Retford. You may eat food from outside in your hotel room, but not in the public hotel spaces.</p>
<h1>Signing up for a game</h1>
<p>Oversubscribed, so there is a lottery. The details of that lottery are HERE.</p>
<p>Don’t worry too much if you don’t get in - we often burn through the waitlist as people drop out.</p>
<h1>Running a weekend larp</h1>
<p>We’d love to see. But writing and running a weekend larp is a huge undertaking. It’s extremely rewarding, but please don’t underestimate how much effort they require.</p>
<p>Get in touch - we’re likely to require you to attend at least one event, so that you can see what is required.</p>
<h1>Previous games</h1>
<ul>
<li>2025: Shogun. For around 72 players, loosely set in late 16th-Century Japan.</li>
<li>2024: West End Lullaby. For 77 players and based on West End musicals.</li>
</ul>
